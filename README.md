# nn_forecasting
A collection of try-outs aimed on predicting (financial) time series with neural networks

*I've decided that it would be a better idea to continue on a private repo, in case I do succeed in predicting the future prices and become incredibly rich ;-)*


## Resources

### Time Series

-----|--------------
[Guide to Time Series frorecast](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/) | Good example of ple of the steps involved in time series prediction 



### Introduction to NN

-----|--------------
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) |  
[Neural Networks Demystified](https://github.com/stephencwelch/Neural-Networks-Demystified) | Fantastic tutorial on building an NN from scratch. Includes very illustrative video lectures. Highly recommended!
[How to build a neural network](http://stevenmiller888.github.io/mind-how-to-build-a-neural-network/) | Very clear description of a simple NN

### Frameworks and libraries

#### Theano

-----|--------------
[Beginner tutorial](http://outlace.com/Beginner-Tutorial-Theano/) | Quick getting started tutorial


#### Keras

-----|--------------
[Keras documentation](https://keras.io) |  original documentation
[Keras recurrent tutorial](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/tree/master/keras/recurrent) |  example of recurrent net. 
[Machine learning mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-with-deep-learning-in-python-with-keras/) | Easy to follow tutorial on time series prediction, but contains pretty serious conceptual mistakes.
